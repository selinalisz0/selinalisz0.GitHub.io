## Overview

Open AI GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a natural language processing model developed by OpenAI. It is based on the transformer architecture, which provides a way to process sequential data. 

## Features

Open AI GPT has several features that make it stand out as a prominent natural language processing model:

- It has been pre-trained on a massive corpus of data, allowing it to understand patterns and relationships in language.
- It is capable of generating natural language text that is coherent and contextually appropriate.
- It can be fine-tuned for a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, text classification and summarization.

## Applications

Open AI GPT has numerous applications in the field of natural language processing. Some of its applications include:

- Language translation
- Text summarization
- Chatbots and conversational AI
- Sentiment analysis
- Language modeling

## Conclusion

Open AI GPT is a powerful tool for natural language processing tasks, thanks to its pre-training on a massive corpus of data and its ability to generate contextually appropriate text. Its flexibility and range of applications make it a valuable addition to any NLP toolkit.

## An Example

To call the GPT API, you can follow these steps:

1. Obtain your API key from OpenAI
2. Install the `openai` Python library using pip
3. In your Python script, import the OpenAI library and set up your API key:

```
import openai
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

4. Call the `openai.Completion.create()` method and pass in your prompt as a string:

```
response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine="text-davinci-002",
  prompt="Write a short story about a robot who learns how to love",
  max_tokens=60
)
```

5. The `response` object will contain the generated text from the GPT API.

6. Print out the generated text in your Python script:

```
print(response.choices[0].text)
```

This will print out the generated text to your console.
