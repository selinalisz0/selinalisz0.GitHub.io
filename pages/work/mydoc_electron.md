## Open Source
Electron is an open source project maintained by GitHub and an active community of contributors.

## Cross Platform
Compatible with Mac, Windows, and Linux, Electron apps build and run on three platforms.

## Explore the Electron APIs
The Electron API Demos app interactively demonstrates the most important features of the Electron API. See what's possible with Electron with sample code and helpful tips for building your app.

## Try more powerful experiments with Electron Fiddle
Electron Fiddle lets you create and play with small Electron experiments. It greets you with a quick-start template after opening – change a few things, choose the version of Electron you want to run it with, and play around. Then, save your Fiddle either as a GitHub Gist or to a local folder. Once pushed to GitHub, anyone can quickly try your Fiddle out by just entering it in the address bar.
